// Global Variable in Java. If possible, do NOT adopt global variable / class state / field if possible.
// Implementation: multi-called by different functions leads to errors.
// When a program's Memory Allocation is too large, consider build a field instead.
// Semantically, queue / stack is a space to store sth is going to be processed.'
// Queue: FIFO. Queue is an interface.
// Stack: FILO.
// Operations in a Queue: 
//            offer() --- offer at the tail
//            poll() --- poll at the head
//            peek() --- look at the head without polling it out
// Deque: FIFO & FILO (both queue and stack). Offer and poll at both head and tail.
//            offer() --- offer at the head / tail
//            poll() --- poll at the head / tail
//            peek() --- look at the head / tail without polling it out
// Common APIs in Queue
//   Type of Operation           Throw Exception           Return Special Value (Null)
//        Insert                       add(e)                       offer(e)
//        Remove                      remove()                      poll()
//        Examine                     element()                     peek()
